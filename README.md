#  A quick glance at Java EE 8

In these days, the most exciting news is Java 9 reaches GA, as well as the release of the long-waiting Java EE 8 and Glassfish v5. For more details, please read the official announcement [Java EE 8 and GlassFish 5.0 Released!](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/java-ee-8-is-final-and-glassfish-50-is-released) from Oracle blog portal.

## A brief intro of Java EE 8

The world was changed so quickly, after Java EE 7 was born in 2013, Cloud service and microservice became more and more popular. Java EE had to embrace the changes, so a lot of perspectives are proposed to be brought into Java EE 8, including Configuration, Load Balance, Circuit breaker, Service Registry and Discovery, programnatic Security API, MVC etc. 

But the road to Java EE 8 is not straight, most of proposed specfications are moved out of Java EE 8 in development progress. In a long period, the development of some specifications were paused for some unknown reasons. 

To save Java EE, the [Java community](https://javaee-guardians.io/) created a [petition](https://www.change.org/p/larry-ellison-tell-oracle-to-move-forward-java-ee-as-a-critical-part-of-the-global-it-industry) and wished Oracle can move forward Java EE more quickly.

At the same time, IBM, Redhat and other Java communities launched a new [MicroProfile](http://microprofile.io) which targets ligthweight Java EE and Cloud computing service. Now it is a project under Eclipse foundation.

Although the Java EE 8 way is a little hard, finally it is released to the public. 

And surprisingly Oracle decided to [open up Java EE progress](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/opening-up-java-ee) and [move it to Eclipse foundation](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/opening-up-ee-update). [An updated petition](https://www.change.org/p/larry-ellison-tell-oracle-to-move-forward-java-ee-as-a-critical-part-of-the-global-it-industry/u/21473794?utm_medium=email&utm_source=petition_update&utm_campaign=146669&sfmc_tk=xZ%2f6z4TGoQ02piKnRtK%2bejNgWC%2bWD6nr3P%2bcjkRrgGJqXJLLTSlXDQ6alq40O5pe&j=146669&sfmc_sub=46994739&l=32_HTML&u=27789648&mid=7259882&jb=1) was created to help moving Java EE to Eclipse more smoothly.

Java EE 8 should be the last version released by Oracle(and Sun).

## What is new in Java EE 8

Like me, some developers are a little disappointed about Java EE 8, even complain it comes a little late. But no doubt there are still lots of new features which are valuable to update ourselves.
